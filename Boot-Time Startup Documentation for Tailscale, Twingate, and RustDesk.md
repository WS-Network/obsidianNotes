## Overview

- **Tailscale:** A secure, zero-config VPN built on WireGuard.
- **Twingate:** A modern remote access solution (commonly deployed as an agent/connector).
- **RustDesk:** An open-source remote desktop solution; here, we assume you run its server components via Docker Compose.

Each section below explains installation (if not already done), configuration, and how to ensure the services start automatically at boot.

---

## 1. Tailscale

Tailscale installs its own daemon (`tailscaled`) that is managed via systemd.

### Installation

If you haven’t already installed Tailscale, run:

bash

Copy code

`curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh`

### Enabling and Starting at Boot

The Tailscale daemon is set up as a systemd service. Enable it with:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl enable tailscaled sudo systemctl start tailscaled`

### Bringing Up Tailscale (Connecting)

After the daemon starts, you need to authenticate and “bring up” your Tailscale connection. For convenience, you can use an authentication key. Run:

bash

Copy code

`sudo tailscale up --authkey <YOUR_AUTH_KEY>`

If you want this command to run automatically after every boot, you can add an override so that it runs right after `tailscaled` starts.

#### Optional: Automate `tailscale up` via a systemd Override

1. Create an override for the `tailscaled` unit:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo systemctl edit tailscaled`
    
2. In the editor, add:
    
    ini
    
    Copy code
    
    `[Service] ExecStartPost=/usr/sbin/tailscale up --authkey <YOUR_AUTH_KEY>`
    
3. Save and exit the editor.
    
4. Restart the service to apply the change:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo systemctl restart tailscaled`

## 2. Twingate

Twingate typically runs as a connector (agent) that is also managed by systemd. (Follow Twingate’s official documentation for the installation package appropriate for your distribution.)

### Installation & Configuration

1. **Install the Twingate Connector:**  
    For example, if you have a Debian package:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo dpkg -i twingate-connector_*.deb`
    
    Then follow the prompts or provided instructions to configure the connector with your organization’s details.
    
2. **Enable and Start the Service:**  
    Twingate’s connector service is usually installed with its own systemd unit. Enable it to start at boot:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo systemctl enable twingate-connector.service sudo systemctl start twingate-connector.service`
    
3. **Verify the Service Status:**
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo systemctl status twingate-connector.service`
    
    Review the logs (using `journalctl`) if you encounter any issues.

## 3. RustDesk (Using Docker Compose)

For RustDesk, assume you run two containers—one for `hbbs` (the server) and one for `hbbr` (the relay)—using Docker Compose. We’ll create a Docker Compose file and a systemd service unit so that the containers start automatically at boot.

### A. Create a Docker Compose File

4. **Prepare the Directory:**  
    Choose (or create) a directory (for example: `/home/youruser/rustdeskdocker`).
    
5. **Create `docker-compose.yml`:**  
    In that directory, create or edit the file:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `version: "3.7" services:   hbbs:     container_name: hbbs     image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest     command: hbbs     volumes:       - ./data:/root     network_mode: "host"     restart: unless-stopped    hbbr:     container_name: hbbr     image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest     command: hbbr     volumes:       - ./data:/root     network_mode: "host"     restart: unless-stopped`
    
6. **Test the Setup Manually:**
    
    In the directory where the file resides, run:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `docker compose up -d`
    
    Ensure the containers start without errors.
    

### B. Create a Systemd Service for RustDesk

7. **Create the Systemd Unit File:**  
    Create a new file at `/etc/systemd/system/rustdesk.service` with your preferred editor (using `sudo`):
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rustdesk.service`
    
8. **Insert the Following Contents:**
    
    ini
    
    Copy code
    
    `[Unit] Description=RustDesk Server (Docker Compose) Requires=docker.service After=docker.service  [Service] Type=oneshot WorkingDirectory=/home/youruser/rustdeskdocker ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up -d ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose down RemainAfterExit=yes  [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target`
    
    **Notes:**
    
    - Update `WorkingDirectory` to the absolute path where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
    - If you use the legacy Docker Compose (the standalone binary), replace `docker compose` with `docker-compose` as needed.
9. **Reload and Enable the Service:**
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable rustdesk.service sudo systemctl start rustdesk.service`
    
10. **Verify the Service:**
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo systemctl status rustdesk.service`
    
    The output should indicate that the service has started successfully and your RustDesk containers are running.

## Summary

- **Tailscale:**
    
    - Install via the provided script.
    - Enable the `tailscaled` service with systemd.
    - Optionally use an override to run `tailscale up --authkey <YOUR_AUTH_KEY>` automatically.
- **Twingate:**
    
    - Install the Twingate Connector package.
    - Configure it per your organization’s instructions.
    - Enable its systemd service (`twingate-connector.service`).
- **RustDesk (via Docker Compose):**
    
    - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for the `hbbs` and `hbbr` containers.
    - Create a systemd unit file (`/etc/systemd/system/rustdesk.service`) to manage Docker Compose at boot.
    - Enable and test the service.

By following these instructions, your device will start Tailscale, Twingate, and RustDesk automatically when it boots, ensuring your VPN, remote access, and remote desktop services are available as soon as the system is up.
