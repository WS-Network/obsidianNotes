### **1. Project Overview**

Develop a multi-script tool that automates:

- **Device discovery** on a network.
- **SSH connection establishment** using user-provided credentials.
- **Fallback discovery and connection via alternative open ports** if SSH is closed.
- **Configuration backup** (exporting current device configurations).
- **Configuration modification** based on an optimal setup determined by an LLM analysis.

Each module should be modular, cleanly separated, and integrated into a unified workflow.

### **2. High-Level Workflow**

1. **Device Discovery & Selection**
    
    - **Scan the Network:** Automatically search for devices on the network.
    - **Display Results:** Present a list of discovered devices to the user.
    - **User Selection:** Allow the user to choose a device from the list and optionally add it to a saved list for future use.
2. **Connection Establishment**
    
    - **Primary Method (SSH):** Attempt to establish an SSH connection using the device’s IP, username, and password provided by the user.
    - **Fallback (Port Discovery):** If the SSH connection is closed/unavailable:
        - Initiate a port discovery routine.
        - Display available open ports (or suggest a specific port) and any additional required connection parameters.
        - Reattempt connection using the alternative details provided by the user.
3. **Post-Connection Procedures**
    
    - **Configuration Backup:** Once a secure connection is established, export the current device configuration to a backup destination.
    - **Configuration Modification:**
        - Determine the optimal configuration setup from a pre-defined list via an LLM model analysis.
        - Apply modifications (optionally in “safe mode”) and then save the new configuration.

### **3. Detailed Modules & Script Responsibilities**

#### **Module A: Device Discovery**

- **Script/Component:** _Discovery Tool_
    - **Responsibilities:**
        - **Network Scanning:** Use network scanning techniques (e.g., ping sweep, ARP scan, or using libraries like `scapy`) to detect devices.
        - **Port Scanning:** If needed, scan for open ports when a standard SSH port is not responding.
        - **Display Interface:** Present the list of discovered devices (IP addresses, device names, etc.) to the user.
    - **Inputs/Outputs:**
        - **Input:** Network range or interface details (if applicable).
        - **Output:** A list of devices with pertinent details (IP, hostname, etc.).

#### **Module B: Device Selection**

- **Script/Component:** _User Selection Interface_
    - **Responsibilities:**
        - Display the discovered devices.
        - Allow the user to select a device.
        - Optionally let the user add the selected device to a “saved list” for quick access in future sessions.
    - **Inputs/Outputs:**
        - **Input:** User selection via a UI/CLI prompt.
        - **Output:** The chosen device’s details (IP, etc.) and updated saved list.

#### **Module C: SSH Connection Establishment**

- **Script/Component:** _SSH Connector_
    - **Responsibilities:**
        - Establish an SSH connection using the device’s IP, and user-provided credentials (username, password).
        - Handle authentication and connection errors gracefully.
    - **Implementation Suggestions:**
        - Use libraries such as `Paramiko` (Python) or equivalent in your chosen language.
    - **Inputs/Outputs:**
        - **Input:** Device IP, username, and password.
        - **Output:** An active SSH session or a clear error state.

#### **Module D: Fallback Connection via Port Discovery**

- **Script/Component:** _Port Discovery & Alternative Connection Handler_
    - **Responsibilities:**
        - Triggered if SSH connection cannot be established.
        - Scan for open ports on the device (or on the network segment) to find alternative methods for connecting.
        - Present available ports and required additional parameters (if any) to the user.
        - Reattempt connection using the alternative method.
    - **Inputs/Outputs:**
        - **Input:** Device IP (failed SSH connection), additional parameters as needed.
        - **Output:** A successful connection via an alternative protocol or a failure message with instructions for next steps.

#### **Module E: Configuration Backup**

- **Script/Component:** _Configuration Exporter_
    - **Responsibilities:**
        - Once a secure connection is established, export the current device configuration.
        - Save the configuration to a specified backup destination (local file system, network storage, etc.).
    - **Inputs/Outputs:**
        - **Input:** Active connection session.
        - **Output:** A backup file containing the device configuration.
    - **Notes:** Ensure error handling to confirm the backup integrity.

#### **Module F: Configuration Modification**

- **Script/Component:** _Config Modifier & LLM Selector_
    - **Responsibilities:**
        - Analyze a predefined list of optimal configurations using an LLM model.
        - Allow the user (or automate) to choose the best-suited configuration setup.
        - Modify the device configuration accordingly.
        - Optionally implement a “safe mode” where changes are applied incrementally or can be rolled back.
        - Save the modified configuration to the device.
    - **Inputs/Outputs:**
        - **Input:** Backup configuration, selected optimal configuration setup.
        - **Output:** Updated device configuration.
    - **Notes:** Ensure the tool logs all changes and provides clear success/failure feedback.

### **4. Integration & Flow**

4. **Initialization:**
    
    - Start the tool and trigger the device discovery module.
5. **Discovery & Selection:**
    
    - Display discovered devices.
    - Allow user selection and update the saved devices list.
6. **Connection Attempt:**
    
    - Attempt SSH connection using provided credentials.
    - If SSH fails:
        - Initiate the port discovery process.
        - Present available alternatives and get any additional required user input.
        - Attempt connection via the alternative method.
7. **Post-Connection Actions:**
    
    - **Backup:** Once a secure connection is made, run the configuration backup script.
    - **Modification:**
        - Run the LLM-based optimal setup selection.
        - Apply configuration modifications (preferably in safe mode).
        - Save the new configuration.
8. **Logging & Exception Handling:**
    
    - Throughout each step, implement robust logging for audit and debugging.
    - Provide clear user feedback for errors and successes.
    - Ensure rollback procedures are in place if configuration changes fail.

### **5. Additional Considerations**

- **Security:**
    
    - Securely handle user credentials (consider using encryption or secure storage methods).
    - Ensure that connections (SSH or alternative) are performed over secure channels.
- **User Interface:**
    
    - Decide on a CLI vs. GUI based on project requirements.
    - Ensure that prompts are clear and that the user is guided through each step.
- **Testing:**
    
    - Unit test each module individually.
    - Perform end-to-end testing on a staging network environment.
- **Documentation:**
    
    - Provide inline documentation within the code.
    - Supply a user guide explaining how to use the tool and its individual features.
- **Dependencies:**
    
    - List all required libraries and packages (e.g., `Paramiko`, `scapy`, etc.) in a `requirements.txt` or equivalent.
